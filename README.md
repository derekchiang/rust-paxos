# Paxos implemented in Rust

This is an implementation of the multi-Paxos consensus protocol.  It's not distributed just yet; right now it's just running on top of multiple processes.  In other words, it's just a demo.

I'm also not too satisfied with how the code is structured, so I might completely rewrite it from scratch someday.

In the future, when Rust's TCP library becomes more stable and feature-complete, I will finish this.
